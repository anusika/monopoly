# monopoly
On December 8, 2016 Matt Parker released a video with Hannah Fry about the probabilities of hitting certain spots on a Monopoly board. Hannah used Markov Chains to calculate her results and Matt used a Python script. Their results matched perfectly despite using two different methods. However, Matt only ran his simulation through Python and did all his analysis in Excel. Using Matt’s code as a basis, I created my own simulation and graphed my results using the matplotlib library. I also added a more complex simulation where the players could buy spots and be forced to pay rent. I tracked the amount of money a player had per game and could analyze the effect of a player’s risky factor (how likely a player is to buy a spot, for example 20% risky vs 50% risky) in winning a game.
